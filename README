Poor Man's Development Utilities for Windows x86_64
===================================================

This project aims to provide a collection of Windows executables that fit the
basic needs of coding. The term `modules` refer to specific software packages
providing the executables. This project is inspired by busybox-w32.

* Simple
* Lightweight
* Standalone
* Free

Build
-----

This project is intended to be cross-built using MinGW-w64 toolchain in Linux.
The binaries are built under Ubuntu 14.04 on Windows 10 via WSL.

License
-------

The Makefile framework is under MIT license. The code, patches and executables
of the modules follow their license respectively.

You can try the following alternatives to be a poor man no more.

* Use a full-featured editor such as Vim instead of busybox vi
* Use a full-featured C compiler such as GCC instead of TinyCC
* Use Linux instead of Windows
